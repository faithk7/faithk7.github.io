## People's banners

## My banners

<div class="text"><img loading="lazy" src="/images/banner.svg" width="88" height="31" alt="An animated banner with one short line, one medium line, one long line, a symbol resembling the tilde, each being drawn in order."></div><div class="text"><img loading="lazy" src="/images/banner.gif" width="88" height="31" alt="An animated banner with one short line, one medium line, one long line, a symbol resembling the tilde, each being drawn in order."></div><div class="text"><img loading="lazy" src="/images/banner.png" width="88" height="31" alt="An banner with one short line, one medium line, one long line, and then a symbol resembling the tilde."></div>

1. Recommended. SVG. This includes dark and light mode and `prefers-reduced-motion`.
2. Plain old GIF. Actually 176&times;62. Please set the dimensions accordingly.
3. Static PNG. Actually 176&times;62. Please set the dimensions accordingly.

I suggest that you hotlink my banner and keep a copy as backup, so that when I update them you get the latest. That is if you trust me enough.
